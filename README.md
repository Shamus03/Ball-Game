Ball-Game
=========

A dinky little game I made in my free time in computer science my senior year.

It supports up to four players, controlled by WASD, IJKL, Arrow keys, and the mouse.

Pretty much everything is programmed as a static class, because I thought that was the
best way to do it.  I need to work on converting it to use the game library I made.
