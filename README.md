# Ball-Game

A simple game I made in my free time in computer science my senior year.

It supports up to four players, controlled by WASD, IJKL, Arrow keys, and the mouse.

Bullets gravitate towards other players and bullets, and they won't collide or gravitate towards objects of the same color.


## Powerups:

  Fast Shot (orange with two black squares)
  
    Makes you shoot twice as fast for a short period.
    
  Health (Red with a white cross)
   
    Increases your health by 10-20%.
    
  Orbital (Grey circle)
    
    Attaches itself to you with an elastic string.
    Swing it around to block bullets and cause damage to other players.
    
  Triple Shot (Green with a yellow triangle)
    
    You will shoot three bullets at a time for a short period.
    
  Shield (Blue circle)
    
    You become invincible for 5-8 seconds.
